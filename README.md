# dispatcher (WIP)
This application takes the locations of orders and dispatches them to drivers in the order they should be delivered.

This algorithm uses [KMeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to cluster the orders and [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) sort them. This is a work in progess, more improvements to come soon!

# todo
- I want to incorporate the Google Maps API to determine coordinates of any given address.
- I want to create a BubbleTea CLI because I recently did a project with BubbleTea and it was fun
- I want to get this on an Android device somehow :)
